This is a really common error that can be fixed by removing one character.
It happens because Rust distinguishes between expressions and statements:
expressions return a value based on their operand(s), and statements simply
return a `()` type which behaves just like `void` in C/C++ language.

We want to return a value of `i32` type from the `square` function, but it is
returning a `()` type...

They are not the same. There are two solutions:
1. Add a `return` ahead of `num * num;`
2. remove `;`, make it to be `num * num`"""
